This is a web application for my personal web site. The technology stack is Angular 2 communicating with a NodeJS/Express backend.

As a quick note, I am aware that for the purposes of a personal website with minimal time spent on an individual page, an SPA built with Angular 2 is by far not the most efficient way. The purpose of this site is not to be incredibly lightweight, but to showcase my ability to develop an Angular 2 application and a corresponding backend. In fact, at some points there may be superfluous calls to the backend, for the pure purpose to create a scenario wherein I needed to build a backend. It is very possible that in the future I will build the same/a similar site using react and redux, but for now my focus is on Angular 2.


The following is generic information about any angular-cli project:

# Personal

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.32.3.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
